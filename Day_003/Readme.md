📜 The Challenge
Beyond the horizon, where the jungle meets the sea, lies a fortune—and certain doom. This project is a test of wits and choice: the classic text-based Treasure Island Game.

Built entirely using Python's fundamental Control Flow (if/elif/else) structure, this code presents a perilous path where every decision dictates whether you return home a legend... or vanish forever.

🗝️ Core Python Concepts Demonstrated
This simple game masters the art of decision-making within code:

Control Flow: Utilizing nested if statements to handle a branching narrative and decision points.

Logical Operators: Ensuring the right path is taken and the wrong one leads swiftly to failure.

String Manipulation: Handling user input to keep the adventurer on track.
